			<p class="dropshadowbox">"But the long tunnels of art through which I walked in Rome that day had no ragged edges, cowardly colors, or shades of themselves. The wisdom, perfection, and beauty of the colors and forms i passed were more than enough, in their collectivity, to hint at the principles which govern the hereafter, whatever that may be. Indeed, even a detail of one painting can offer solid direction in this regard if one knows how to look."
